## Introduction to Linux
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system that powers a wide range of devices, from personal computers to servers and embedded systems. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.
### Features of Linux:
- Open-source and free
- Multi-user and multitasking
- Secure and stable
- Customizable (various distributions available)
- Strong community support
## Installing Linux
There are multiple ways to install Linux, depending on the distribution and the system requirements.

### 1. Choosing a Linux Distribution
Popular Linux distributions include:
- **Ubuntu** - Beginner-friendly and widely used
- **Fedora** - Cutting-edge features with stability
- **Debian** - Reliable and community-driven
- **Arch Linux** - Highly customizable, for advanced users
- **CentOS/Rocky Linux** - Enterprise-grade stability

### 2. Installation Methods
#### a) Installing Linux on a PC
1. **Download the ISO** file of your chosen Linux distribution from the official website.
2. **Create a bootable USB drive** using tools like Rufus (Windows) or `dd` (Linux/Mac).
3. **Boot from the USB drive** by selecting it in the BIOS/UEFI boot menu.
4. **Follow the installation prompts**, including partitioning, user creation, and software selection.
5. **Restart and log in** to your new Linux system.

#### b) Installing Linux in a Virtual Machine
1. Install a virtualization tool like VirtualBox or VMware.
2. Create a new virtual machine and allocate resources.
3. Mount the Linux ISO as a boot disk.
4. Follow the installation steps as for a physical machine.

#### c) Dual Booting with Windows
1. Shrink an existing Windows partition to free space.
2. Follow the standard installation steps and select "Install alongside Windows."
3. Configure the bootloader (GRUB) to manage both operating systems.

## Difference Between Unix and Linux
| Feature          | Unix                                       | Linux                                      |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Origin         | Developed in the 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs | Inspired by Unix, developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 |
| Open-source    | Mostly proprietary, some open-source variants exist | Fully open-source and freely available |
| Distributions  | Various commercial versions (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris) | Multiple distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Arch) |
